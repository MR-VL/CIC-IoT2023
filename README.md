***Key Features***

Feature Engineering

Custom feature: Packets_Duration_Ratio = Tot sum / (Duration + 1e-6)

Data clustering (reduce CPU and Memory Load) 



**Sampling & Balancing**

Stratified sampling for preserving class distribution

Custom Data Diffusion: Adds Gaussian noise to underrepresented classes after sampling 5% of chunked data

SMOTE based sampling

Simple Undersampling


**Model Evaluation**

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Classification of Original vs Synthetic (Sampled) data to assess realism of synthetic data


**Models**

RandomForestClassifier

XGBClassifier

**Requirements**

Jupyter Notebook 7.2.2 or Higher
pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost (required for XGBoost IPYNB, not required for others)


**Running the Project**

Place your CIC-IoT .csv files inside the CIC/ folder

Open CIC analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Run cells sequentially to:

Sample data

Perform feature engineering

Train and evaluate models


**Notes**

Designed for experimentation with real vs synthetic classification

All models tested on chunked CSVs using 5% samples (Depending on computer performance you can increase amount of sampled data to keep)

Intended for research into detection generalization & class balance challenges


**Hardware**

The code was built and ran off of 

```
Windows 10 Enterprise LSTC
Interl(R) Core(TM) i7-10700 CPU
Memory: 16GB DDR4
```
*This code does not utilize GPU*

For lower end systems it may not be possible to run or take extremely long time to run due to hardware limitations.
